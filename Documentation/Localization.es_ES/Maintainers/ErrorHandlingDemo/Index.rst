=======================================
Demostración del tratamiento de errores
=======================================

The extension provides a simple FE plugin for demonstrating error
handling output in the FE. The settings related to the error handler
should be changed to provide different output. It seems hard to get
all the possible output, support for all possible settings may be
buggy in the Core or has changed over the past and documentation
should be adapted accordingly.
