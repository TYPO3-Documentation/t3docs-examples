Most of the customizations provided by the code samples contained in
this example are activated by default. So don't be surprised if you
find strange things here and there in your TYPO3 backend.

Whenever possible, the usage of a given piece of code is described in
the source code with the following type of PHP comments

.. code-block:: php

   // USAGE: Core APIs > TYPO3 API overview > Various examples > Support for custom tables in the Page module

This makes it easier to relate a given code sample to a precise place
in a manual. The other way round, it should possible to search for a
chapter title in the source code and find the relevant code sample.
